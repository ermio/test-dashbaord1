intro: Provide liquidity on Uniswap to earn BAS.

Whether the Basis Cash protocol is in expansion or contraction, you can earn **Basis Shares (BAS)** in the Basis Bank, by providing liquidity on Uniswap.

Here’s how it works:

1.  Provide liquidity to either (or both) the [BAC-DAI](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x3449fc1cd036255ba1eb19d65ff4ba2b8903a69a/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f) or/and [BAS-DAI](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f/0xa7ed29b253d8b4e3109ce07c80fc570f81b63696) pools at Uniswap. If you’d like to deposit a single asset, [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi) allows you to do that on its Invest screen; just search on BAC or BAS to find the right pool.
2.  When you make your deposit on Uniswap, you’ll receive a “UNI LP” token as receipt. Stake this token by “selecting” the appropriate box on the Basis Bank screen, then clicking the “+” button.
3.  Once staked in the Bank, you’ll immediately start earning BAS tokens, which you can withdraw at any time using the “Settle” button.

Important things to know:

- Unlike some other algorithmic stablecoin projects, there are no complicated time lock-ups determining when you can claim your rewards, or remove your liquidity.
