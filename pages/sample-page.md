title: Uniswap & Basis Cash Farming
intro: Here’s how to maximize your yield with Uniswap & Basis Cash Farming!
---

Uniswap is currently providing $UNI tokens to people who deposit into one of four liquidity pools — ETH-USDT, ETH-USDC, ETH-DAI and ETH-WBTC

Basis Cash have launched version 0.69 of its Jar product, that farms and sells UNI tokens on behalf of its users, for the three pools that involve USD stablecoins. Furthermore, Basis Cash have launched three new Basis Cash Farms, that additionally allow Jar users to earn the $Basis Cash token!

The process is as follows:

1. **Deposit one of the ETH/USD_TOKEN pairs at Uniswap.** Uniswap provide you with UNI-LP tokens as "receipt" for your deposit. Although you won't see these tokens in your wallet, they are available for use at Basis Cash.
2. **Deposit your UNI-LP tokens in the corresponding Basis Cash 0.69 Jar.** Note that this requires two transactions: approving, and then depositing.
3. In receipt of your UNI-LP deposit, you will receive pUNI tokens.
4. At this point, the Basis Cash Jar will farm and sell $UNI tokens on your behalf. The result is that your pUNI tokens—*priced in UNI-LP!*—will rise over time, such that when you exit the Jar, you will receive more UNI-LP tokens than you deposited. You will NOT see this increase in the Jar balance, because the Jar balance displays your pUNI balance, which always stays the same.
5. To further benefit, you can now visit the Farm page, and **"stake" your pUNI tokens in the respective Basis Cash Farm.** Again, this requires two transactions: Approval, then Staking.
7. At this point, you'll start receiving $Basis Cash tokens you can harvest on the Farm page, at any time.
8. The overall APY that you're earning is the *combined total* of the Jar APY and the Farm APY! 
9. You will notice that the APYs of the Jars and Farms are dynamically adjusted to incentive the use of stablecoins that are not on their 1-to-1 peg. This ties back to the overall objective of the Basis Cash project.
10. To get out, you simply **reverse the procedure at any time**: Unstake your pUNI-LP tokens on the Farm page, and then withdraw your UNI-LP tokens from the Jars page. Note that withdrawing UNI-LP tokens from the Jars page incurs a **fee of 0.5% of your balance at time of withdrawal.** (At current APYs, you'd need to leave your deposit for about three days to break even.)
